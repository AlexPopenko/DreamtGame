DreamtGame

A two player turn-based strategy game that I once had a dream about.

I think my project will be a game I had a dream about playing with a friend one time! I've started this game in python, but only got as far as drawing the game board and having one game piece rotate on command. It would be a turn based strategy game, where there is a random spread of polygonal "Towers" on each side of the board, from which the players would take turns shooting projectiles at the other side. The goal would be to destroy all the opposing pieces. The towers would each be one of three colors, being able to only destroy an opposing piece of the same color as it, with an option to cycle an opposing piece's color on your turn. If you hit an opposing piece with a projectile of a differing color, the projectile is reflected, potentially allowing you to hit a piece otherwise shielded by other pieces. There could non-player obstacles on the screen. Some of these ideas might not work fairly in practice, since they were all created by dream logic about two and a half years ago, but I think with some tweaking it could be fun! The player information would be stored in a database, and the displayed pages would show the actual game board.
